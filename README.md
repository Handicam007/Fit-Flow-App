### Database Setup

To set up your own Supabase backend:

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your Supabase URL and anon key from the project settings
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
4. Run the database setup script in the Supabase SQL Editor:
   - Copy the contents of `setup-database.sql` 
   - Paste into the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Run the SQL queries

### Authentication Setup

The application includes a complete authentication system with:
- Email/password sign-in
- User registration
- Password reset functionality
- Profile settings

To enable authentication in Supabase:
1. Go to Authentication > Providers in your Supabase dashboard
2. Enable Email provider
3. Configure your site URL and redirect URLs:
   - Site URL: Your deployed application URL
   - Redirect URLs: 
     - `https://your-app-url.vercel.app/auth-callback`
     - `https://your-app-url.vercel.app/settings`

### Deployment with Vercel

For deployment with Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure the environment variables in Vercel:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
