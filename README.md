### Database Setup

If you want to use your own Supabase backend:

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your Supabase URL and anon key from the project settings
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
4. Run the database setup script in the Supabase SQL Editor:
   - Copy the contents of `setup-database.sql` 
   - Paste into the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Run the SQL queries

### Offline Mode

The application includes fallback sample data and works without a Supabase connection. All CRUD operations will work locally within the current session.
